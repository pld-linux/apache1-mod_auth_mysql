This document describes how to use group-based authorization using my
version of mod_auth_mysql.c.  This version is based heavily on my own
version of mod_auth_msql.c, which was widely distributed prior to the
one currently shipped with Apache.

There are two options to using groups.  You can put the "user_group"
field into the same table as the user database if each user is in only
one group, or you can have a separate table that contains the fields
"user_name" and "user_group" if each user is a member of multiple
groups.

If the user_group field is part of the full user table, the table has
three fields at least: user_name, user_group, user_passwd.  The
user_group field must be "PRIMARY KEY" in the user database containing
a password.  The htaccess file would be this:

AuthName My Authorization
AuthType Basic
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthMySQLHost localhost
AuthMySQLDB authdata
AuthMySQLUserTable user_info
AuthMySQLGroupField user_group
require group admin

If you have a separate database for groups, the two tables would be

user_info: user_name, user_passwd (user_name must be PRIMARY KEY)
user_group: user_name, user_group (user is not PRIMARY KEY, as we have
	multiple tuples for user_name,user_group to let a user be in
	multiple groups)

and htaccess would have this:

AuthName My Authorzation
AuthType Basic
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthMySQLHost localhost
AuthMySQLDB authdata
AuthMySQLUserTable user_info

AuthMySQLGroupTable my_groups
AuthMySQLGroupField user_group
require group admin



Assuming that the required group name is "admin".
